# High level overview

FLUFFI is a distributed system. Within this system, so-called agents (e.g., TestcaseRunners, TestcaseGenerators) are distributed to executor machines. The fuzzing target needs to be installed on these machines.

The agents are coordinated by a GlobalManager running on a central server. A DHCP/DNS server, a solution to deploy software to executor machines (consisting of a polemarch installation, an ftp and an smb server), a monitoring solution, and some helper services all run on the same central server.

FLUFFI is supposed to be set up in its own subnet with the central server having the static IP address 250.154.201.187.

This repository contains 
- the code of the distributed system ([here](core))
- a build environment to build the distributed system agents for Windows(x64/x86) and Linux(x64/x86/ARM/ARMarch64) ([here](build))
- the central server infrastructure in the form of docker containers ([here](srv))
- a monitoring plugin to monitor agent systems ([here](monitoring_client))
- some IDA Pro scripts that help you analyze FLUFFI's fuzzing process ([here](ida_scripts))
